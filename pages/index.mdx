# Welcome to Web Development 2

This course is a continuation of Web Development 1 and provides an in-depth exploration of full-stack web application development. Building on the foundations established in the previous course, we will delve into intermediate JavaScript, explore the functionalities of React.js - a front-end JavaScript library, and learn to leverage the power of Next.js - a robust full-stack framework.

While the program includes a certain amount of theoretical content, it primarily focuses on practical, hands-on coding.

Your performance in this course will be evaluated based on the following assessments:

| Assessment   | Weight (%)        |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Assignments  | 9 x 5% each = 45% |
| Midterm Exam | 20%               |
| Project      | 35%               |
| **Total**    | **100%**          |

Success in this course hinges on your consistent engagement with weekly activities and timely completion of assignments.

With this course, you'll transition from merely building websites to crafting full-fledged web applications!
I wish you the best of luck and am confident that you'll find the course both challenging and rewarding.
