## Part 2: Application Requirements

Create a React component in the project `/app` folder called `StudentInfo` that returns the following static information:

- A link to your GitHub repository

On the page at the root path `/`:

- Renders `StudentInfo`
- Add a link to `/week2`

Create a new page at the path `/week2`. On this page:

Use the `Link` component from Next.js to link to your GitHub repository and to link from the root path `/` to the new page.

The [Guide: Coding Workflow](/guides-and-references/workflow) may help you with the coding workflow.

There is no requirement to style the page.

There is no requirement to deploy the application, but you may do so if you wish. See [Guide: Deploying a Next.js Application](/guides-and-references/deploying-nextjs-app) for instructions.

A demo of the application can be found at [https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/](https://cprg306-assignments.vercel.app/).
