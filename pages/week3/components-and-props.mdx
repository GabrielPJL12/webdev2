# Components and Props

## JS Skills Needed

Mastering key JavaScript concepts such as objects, JSON, destructuring, and template literals equips you with the essential tools to effectively utilize React's components and props. While these JavaScript concepts are fundamental for understanding React's components and props, they can be complex and challenging to grasp, requiring focused learning and consistent practice. Take your time with these topics, and don't be afraid to revisit them as you progress through the course.

### Objects

Objects in JavaScript are standalone entities that can have properties and behavior. They are essentially collections of key-value pairs, where keys are property names and values are the corresponding property values. Objects are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript, and they are used extensively in React.

In this first example, we are creating a simple JavaScript object called user with properties name and age, and then demonstrating how to access and modify those properties.

```js
// Create the object and assign it to a variable
let user = { name: "John", age: 25 };

// Access the properties of the object
console.log(user.name); // Outputs: 'John'
console.log(user.age); // Outputs: 25

// Modify the properties of the object
user.name = "Ling";
user.age = 30;

// Now, if we access the properties again, we'll see the updated values
console.log(user.name); // Outputs: 'Ling'
console.log(user.age); // Outputs: 30
```

The second example expands on the first by introducing a more complex, nested object, which includes an address object and a coordinates object within address; this example further demonstrates how to access and modify properties in nested objects.

```js
// Create the object and assign it to a variable
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Calgary",
    coordinates: {
      lat: 50.067,
      long: 14.467,
    },
  },
};

// Access the properties of the object
console.log(user.name); // Outputs: 'John'
console.log(user.address.city); // Outputs: 'Calgary'
console.log(user.address.coordinates.lat); // Outputs: 50.067

// Modify the properties of the object
user.name = "Ling";
user.address.city = "Edmonton";
user.address.coordinates.lat = 60.087;

// Now, if we access the properties again, we'll see the updated values
console.log(user.name); // Outputs: 'Ling'
console.log(user.address.city); // Outputs: 'Edmonton'
console.log(user.address.coordinates.lat); // Outputs: 60.087
```

    JavaScript is unique amongst many object-oriented (OO) languages in that it doesn't inherently utilize classes for object-oriented programming. Instead, JavaScript employs a prototype-based inheritance model, which is a form of object-oriented programming where classes are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes.

    This approach stands in contrast to many other OO languages like Java, C++, or Python, where classes are defined and then objects are created from these classes. In JavaScript, you create objects directly and then link them to a prototype object for behavior reuse.

    However, it's worth noting that as of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript introduced a `class` syntax that provides a much cleaner and simpler way to achieve object-oriented behavior similar to other OO languages. Yet, under the hood, JavaScript still uses its prototype-based model ‚Äî the class syntax is syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

### JSON

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is purely a data format ‚Äî it contains only properties, no methods. It has become a popular data interchange format due to its simplicity and lightweight nature, making it ideal for data storage and transmission over the network in web APIs.

JSON data format is quite similar to a JavaScript object. For instance, a JSON representation of a person could look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25,
  "city": "Calgary"
}
```

In this example, we have a JSON object that represents a person with properties name, age, and city. The keys in a JSON object are always strings, while the values can be a string, number, boolean, another JSON object, an array, or null.

### Destructuring

Destructuring assignment in JavaScript is a syntax feature that enables a developer to unpack values from objects into distinct variables. This can greatly simplify code that needs to access multiple properties of an object. Instead of accessing properties one by one using dot notation, you can extract multiple properties in one statement.

Consider an object person defined as follows:

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  city: "Calgary",
};
```

Instead of accessing the properties individually like `person.name`, `person.age`, and `person.city`, with destructuring, you can extract all these properties in a single line

```js
const { name, age, city } = person;
```

Now, name, age, and city are variables in their own right, each holding the corresponding value from the person object. This can make your code cleaner and more readable, especially when working with objects that have many properties.

### Template Literals

Template literals in JavaScript are a way to output variables in the string. Introduced in ES6, they provide a more readable and concise way to work with strings. Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (\`) character instead of double or single quotes. They can contain placeholders, indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces ( `${expression}`). The expressions in the placeholders and the text between them get passed to a function.

Template literals enhance readability by allowing direct embedding of expressions within strings, eliminating the need for the + operator used in messy string concatenation like `const greeting = "Hello" + name`. They support:

- multiline strings without escape characters, e.g. \\n
- simplifying handling of large text blocks or HTML generation
- seamless integration of any valid JavaScript expression, including functions and arithmetic, directly into the string

**Example 1:** In this example, the name variable is inserted directly into the string using the ${} syntax.

```js
let name = "Bob";
let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name}.`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, my name is Bob."
```

**Example 2:** In this example, we're not only inserting variables into the string, but we're also using JavaScript expressions. The `${quantity > 1 ? 's' : ''}` part is a ternary operator that adds an 's' if more than one item is bought. The total cost is calculated with `${(quantity \* price).toFixed(2)}`, showing how you can call functions like toFixed within a template literal.

```js
let item = "apple";
let quantity = 5;
let price = 0.5;

let receipt = `You bought ${quantity} ${item}${
  quantity > 1 ? "s" : ""
}. Total cost is $${(quantity * price).toFixed(2)}.`;
console.log(receipt); // Output: "You bought 5 apples. Total cost is $2.50."
```

## Tailwind CSS Skills Needed

### Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that offer pre-designed components, Tailwind allows developers to compose complex designs directly in their markup without leaving HTML.

Why use Tailwind CSS?

- **Customization:** Tailwind is highly customizable, enabling unique design creation instead of enforcing predetermined styles.
- **Responsiveness:** It has built-in responsive design utilities, making it easier to design for various screen sizes.
- **Efficiency:** By composing classes in your markup, you can create complex designs without switching between HTML and CSS files, improving development speed.

Example: we use Tailwind's utility classes like `px-4` (padding on the x-axis), `py-2` (padding on the y-axis), `text-white` (text color), `bg-blue-500` (background color), and `rounded` (border radius) to style a button in a React component. The `hover:bg-blue-600` class applies a darker background color on hover.

```js
const Button = () => {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
      Click me
    </button>
  );
};
```

    <button className="px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
      Click me
    </button>
