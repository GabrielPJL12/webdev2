## Brightspace Announcements

### Start of Semester

**Subject: Welcome to CPRG-306!**

Welcome to Web Development 2! In this course we'll explore the fundamental concepts and technologies that power modern web applications.

We'll begin with an introduction to web application development, where you'll learn the basics and set up your development environment. In the subsequent weeks, we'll delve into React, understanding components, props, state management, and architecture. You'll learn how to add interactivity to your applications, handle lists, and fetch data from APIs.

In the latter half of the course, we'll focus on server-side technologies and advanced React concepts. You'll get hands-on experience with Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and REST APIs. We'll also cover Next.js, including routing and the different rendering methods.

The course will culminate in a project where you'll apply everything you've learned to build your own web application. The last week is reserved for an optional project showcase, where you can share your work with your peers.

In addition to the project, there are 10 small assignments due every two weeks and a midterm exam.

Happy coding, and here's to a great semester together!

For this class, you'll need to review the Week 1 materials available at https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week1. If any questions arise as you go through the material, feel free to message me privately in the chat, post your question publicly here, or call me through MS Teams for one-on-one support.

Take this first week to get comfortable with the layout of the course and the rhythm of online and in-person learning. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this course, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Looking forward to seeing you all in class later this week!

### Week 2
