# Guide: How to Create a New Next.js Project

### Part 1. Create a New Next.js Project

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Open a Terminal

Open a terminal on your computer. On Windows, you can open a terminal by pressing the Windows key and typing "cmd" and pressing Enter.

### Navigate to the Desired Directory

Change to the desired directory (folder) where you would like your project to be located. For example, if you want to create a project in a folder called `cprg306-projects`, you would type the following commands:

```shell
C:
cd \
mkdir cprg306
cd cprg306
```

  Do not use a cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox) for your
  project. This can cause problems with the `node_modules` folder because it
  contains thousands of files and will cause the cloud drive to sync constantly.
</Callout>

### Create the New Next.js Project

Enter the following command in the terminal to create a new Next.js project:

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout emoji="😣">
  If you receive an error like the following: `npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such
  file or directory, lstat 'C:\Users\[profile-name]\AppData\Roaming\npm'`, you
  may need to create a folder called `npm` in your Windows AppData\Roaming
  folder. You can do this by typing the following command in the terminal:
  `mkdir %AppData%\npm`
</Callout>

The create-next-app application will scaffold (create/generate) a new Next.js project. For the assignments, here is how you must answer the questions:

| Question                                              | Answer              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| What is your project named?                           | cprg306-assignments |
| Would you like to use TypeScript?                     | No                  |
| Would you like to use ESLint?                         | Yes                 |
| Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?                   | Yes                 |
| Would you like to use `src/` directory?               | No                  |
| Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)       | Yes                 |
| Would you like to customize the default import alias? | No                  |

Use the arrow keys to select the desired answer, then press Enter.

> Note: It is also possible to use the following non-interactive command to create a new Next.js project:
> `npx create-next-app@latest cprg306-assignments --js --eslint --tailwind --no-src-dir --app --import-alias "@/*"`

### Close the Terminal

You can close the terminal now. From now on, you will only use the terminal in VS Code.

</Steps>

## Part 2: Running Your Next.js Application

<Steps>

### Open the New Project in VS Code

Open the project in VS Code using File -> Open... and select the [app-name] folder that you have just created.

### Open the terminal in VS Code

You can open the terminal in VS Code by going to View -> Terminal or by pressing Ctrl-` (backtick - the key is usually located at the top left of the keyboard).

### Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the Next.js development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Open the Application in Your Web Browser

After running npm run dev, a link to your local application (typically `http://localhost:3000`) will appear in the terminal. You can Ctrl-click this link to open it directly in your default web browser. If this doesn't work, you can manually open your preferred web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar. You should see your new Next.js application running!

### Stopping Development

When you are finished coding for the day and wish to shut down VS Code, you should shutdown the development server. In the terminal, press Ctrl-c to shut it down.

</Steps>

## Part 3: Push Your Project to GitHub Using GitHub Desktop

<Steps>

### Open GitHub Desktop

### Add Local Repository

Click on File -> Add local repository... and choose the folder for [app-name].

### Publish repository

Click the button "Push repository". It is recommended to keep the GitHub repository the same name as the app name.

**Uncheck "Keep this code private"** to allow the instructor access to your repository. Private repositories will be given a grade of 0.

Click the button "Publish repository".

### View the Repository Code

In a browser, navigate to `https://github.com/[GitHub-username]/[app-name]` to see the code in your browser.

</Steps>
