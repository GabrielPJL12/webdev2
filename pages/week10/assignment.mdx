# Week 10 Assignment

## Overview

This week's assignment completes the Shopping List application by adding a database! We will continue from the Week 8 Assignment where we added authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this assignment, you should have completed the Week 8 Assignment and have working authentication. If you have not completed the Week 8 assignment, use another student's Week 8 Assignment as a starting point for this week's assignment. Refer to the list of [student repositories](/github-accounts).

## Part 1: Duplicate the Week 8 Assignment

Create a `week10` folder in your Next.js project and copy the contents of your `week8` folder into it.

## Part 2: Add Cloud Firestore in Firebase

<Steps>

### Firebase console

Navigate to the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and to the project you created in Week 8.

### Add Cloud Firestore service

Under the Product Categories menu on the left, click "Build" and then click on the "Cloud Firestore".

Click on the "Create database" button.

In the pop-up window, use the default settings and click "Next".

Select "Start in production mode" and click "Enable".

### Configure Firestore rules

Click on the "Rules" tab and replace the default rules with the following. These rules will only allow authenticated users (`request.auth != null`) to read and write to their own documents (`request.auth.uid == userId`).

```js
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        match /items/{itemId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Click on the "Publish" button to publish the new rules.

</Steps>

The data in Cloud Firestore will have the following structure.

- users collection
  - userId document
    - items subcollection
      - itemId document

</Callout>

## Part 3: Add Cloud Firestore to the Shopping List application

<Steps>

### Update `_utils/firebase.js`

In the `firebase.js` file, add the following import statement:

```js
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
```

Add the following export statement to the end of the file:

```js
export const db = getFirestore();
```

### Add a service to access Cloud Firestore

Create a new folder called `_services` in your `week10` folder. Create a new file called `shopping-list-service.js` in the `_services` folder.

### Add the `getShoppingList` function

First, you'll define an asynchronous function `getItems` that takes `userId` as a parameter. Inside this function, create an empty array `items` and a query `q` that points to the `items` subcollection of the `user` document with the given `userId` in the `users` collection. Then, use the `getDocs` function to fetch the documents from Firestore based on your query, storing the result in `querySnapshot`. Iterate over `querySnapshot` using `forEach`, and for each document, push an object into the items array that includes the document ID and data. Finally, return the `items` array from the function.

### Add the `addItem` function

Begin by defining an asynchronous function `addItem` that takes in `userId` and `item` as parameters. Within this function, first construct a reference `itemsCollection` to the `items` subcollection of the `user` document with the provided `userId` in the `users` collection. Then, use the `addDoc` function to add the `item` to this collection. `addDoc` will return a `DocumentReference` to the newly added document, which you store in `docRef`. Finally, return the `id` of the newly created document from the function.

</Steps>

## Part 4: Update the Shopping List application

<Steps>

### Delete JSON data

Delete the `shopping-list/items.json` file since we will no longer be using hard-coded data.

Remove the import statement for the `items.json` file from `shopping-list/page.js`.

### Import the `shopping-list-service.js` file

In `shopping-list/page.js`, import `getItems` and `addItem` functions from the `shopping-list-service.js` file.

Also import `useEffect` from React.

### Get the shopping list

Create an async function `loadItems`. Inside this function, call the `getItems` function to get the shopping list items for the current user using `user.uid` as the `userId`. Use `setItems` to set the state of `items` to the result of `getItems`.

### Add the `useEffect` hook

Add the `useEffect` hook to the `ShoppingList` component. The `useEffect` hook will call the `loadItems` function when the component is mounted. Determine what the dependencies should be for the `useEffect` hook.

### Handle adding an item

Update the `handleAddItem` function to call the `addItem` function to add the item to the shopping list. Use `user.uid` as the `userId` parameter. Use the `id` returned from `addItem` to set the `id` of the new item. Use `setItems` to set the state of `items` to include the new item.

</Steps>

## Optional Challenge

Add the ability to delete an item from the shopping list!
