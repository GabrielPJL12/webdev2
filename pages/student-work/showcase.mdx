  Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface.
Next.js: A React framework that enabled server-side rendering and routing.
Firebase: Used for user authentication and as a real-time database for storing to-do items.

Challenges Faced:

- User Authentication: Implementing a secure and seamless authentication process was challenging, especially ensuring the user state was managed correctly across the application.

- Real-Time Data Syncing: Ensuring that the to-do list updates in real-time for each user presented some technical difficulties, which required careful state management and effective use of Firebase's real-time database capabilities.

- Responsive Design: Creating a responsive design that provided a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes was a significant focus.

### ChapterPulse

Chapter is a simple web application that allows players to log-in and log-out using their Github Credentials and have access to a small selection of manga. They are able to create a 'Manga list' where you are able to keep track of what you are reading currently, taking a break from, or stopped reading. You can give your thoughts on each book and rate them accordingly. You can sort them based on title, status and rating, while deleting any entries from your list or editing your rating, comments or how many chapters you've read.

The main struggles with this project was the the fetching of the api. I had to request it in order to gain access to it, but I was worried I wouldn't receive it in time, let alone at all. When I finally found a free one online, I had about less than a week to get it working, and I had learned this way how much I struggled to understand api fetching. Due to the time constraints, I wasn't able to get the api working like i wanted too, I had to hard code the manga data in for it to show what I wanted it to on screen.

Technologies used: React, next.js, Firebase authentication, link, tailwind css, es6 features, use state, use effect, jsx, client side rendering, css in Javascript
