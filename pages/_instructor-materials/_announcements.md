# Weekly Announcements

## Brightspace Announcements

### Start of Semester

**Subject: Welcome to CPRG-306!**

Welcome to Web Development 2! In this course we'll explore the fundamental concepts and technologies that power modern web applications.

We'll begin with an introduction to web application development, where you'll learn the basics and set up your development environment. In the subsequent weeks, we'll delve into React, understanding components, props, state management, and architecture. You'll learn how to add interactivity to your applications, handle lists, and fetch data from APIs.

In the latter half of the course, we'll focus on server-side technologies and advanced React concepts. You'll get hands-on experience with Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and REST APIs. We'll also cover Next.js, including routing and the different rendering methods.

The course will culminate in a project where you'll apply everything you've learned to build your own web application. The last week is reserved for an optional project showcase, where you can share your work with your peers.

In addition to the project, there are 10 small assignments due every two weeks and a midterm exam.

Happy coding, and here's to a great semester together!

### Week 7

**Week 7: Fetching Data**

Week 7: Fetching Data

Building upon our understanding of state in React applications from last week, we move onto the topic of fetching data. This process involves retrieving data from a source, typically a server or an API (Application Programming Interface), and using that data to update your application's state or display on the user interface. Fetching data allows your application to be dynamic, displaying up-to-date information from databases, other websites, or user inputs.

Here's a rundown of the concepts we'll be covering:

- **Understanding HTTP and CORS**: HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the protocol used for transferring data over the internet. It defines a set of rules for how messages should be formatted and transmitted. CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
- **JavaScript Skills for Fetching Data**: Fundamental JavaScript skills that are essential for fetching data include understanding asynchronous programming, error handling, and using the Fetch API.
- **React `useEffect` Hook**: The useEffect hook in React allows you to perform side effects in function components. Side effects could be anything that affects something outside of the scope of the function being executed, such as data fetching.

Week 7 Course Materials: https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week7

For this online class, I recommend the following:

- **ðŸ¥‡ Best Option**: Watch the video materials and complete the online class reading and activities: https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week7
- **ðŸ¥ˆ Second Best Option**: Finish the Week 6 Assignment: https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week6/assignment

Have a great week and see you in class!

### Week 8

Week 8: Firebase Authentication

We've explored fetching data and managing state in our React applications, and now we're diving into the realm of authentication. This week, we will learn about Firebase Authentication, a comprehensive identity solution for web applications. Firebase Authentication provides support for multiple authentication methods such as passwords, phone numbers, and popular identity providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub.

Here are the key concepts we will cover this week:

- **Firebase Authentication**: Understand how Firebase Authentication provides an end-to-end identity solution for web applications. Learn how Firebase handles user sessions, making your applications secure and easy to integrate.

- **Security Skills**: Get to know the core concepts of web application security, including the difference between authentication and authorization, the use, and function of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and how to handle and store sensitive information securely.

- **React Skills**: Deepen your understanding of key React concepts, including the use of children prop, React context for passing data through the component tree, and custom hooks for reusing component logic. We'll explore how these concepts can be applied in the context of user authentication.

- **Next.js Skills**: Learn how to use environment variables to allow your Next.js app to behave differently based on the environment, and how to define layouts using a layout.js file.

- **Firebase Skills**: Dive deeper into Firebase and explore its software development kit (SDK) and how to use it to interact with Firebase services. We'll also learn about Firebase Authentication in more detail, including how to manage user sessions.
