## Part 2: Course Demo Repository

You can use the following steps to clone and run any Next.js project repository from GitHub. In this part, you will clone the course demo repository. Please note that the course demo repository is not finished yet. I will continue to add more content to it as we progress through the course. In the following weeks, you will be able to pull the latest changes from the course demo repository to get the latest content.

<Steps>
### Clone the course demo repository

Open GitHub Desktop and select "Clone a repository from the Internet...".

Choose the tab "URL" and enter the following repository URL: warsylewicz/webdev2-demos

Choose a local path where you want to clone the repository to on your computer. It is recommended to NOT use a location that is synced with a cloud service such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or Dropbox.

Click "Clone".

### View and run the course demo repository

Open Visual Studio Code and select "File" > "Open Folder..." and select the folder where you cloned the course demo repository to.

For the question "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?" selected "Yes, I trust the authors".

Open a terminal in VS Code by selecting "View" -> "Terminal" and type the following commands:

```PowerShell
npm install

npm run dev
```

You should see output that shows something like this:

```PowerShell
- ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000"
```

Ctrl-click on the URL to open the application in your browser. You should see a page where you can click "Week 1".

**Congratulations! You have successfully cloned and run the course demo repository.**
