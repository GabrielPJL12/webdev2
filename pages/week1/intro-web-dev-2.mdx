## Getting Help

No matter how you learn, sometimes you'll hit a snag. When that happens, remember that you have multiple resources available to help you!

### During Class

- **Classmates:** Your classmates are a great resource. Remember that everyone is learning and someone might have a different perspective or have overcome the exact challenge you're facing. Be open to collaborating and helping each other out.

- **Instructor:** I'm here to guide you through your learning journey. During class, don't hesitate to ask questions, whether they're about the course content or broader concepts. Remember, the only silly question is the one not asked.

### Outside of Class

- **Classmates:** Even outside of class hours, consider setting up study groups or chat sessions with your classmates. This not only helps clarify concepts, but it also builds a community of learners.

- **AI Tools:** AI tools like GitHub Copilot, chat-based AI tools, or AI-driven documentation tools can be great for troubleshooting code problems, understanding new concepts, or providing new perspectives.

- **SAIT Tutor:** If you're stuck on a concept or need additional help outside of class time, SAIT provides free tutoring services. Make sure to use this resource if you're feeling overwhelmed or need extra help understanding a concept.

Always remember, struggling is a normal part of the learning process, so don't be shy about reaching out for help.

## AI Assisted Tools

As future web developers, it's essential to stay current with emerging technologies that can aid and streamline your development process. In this course, I encourage the use of AI assisted tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

### Chat-based Tools

These chat-based AI tools can be extremely helpful in various stages of your learning journey. From brainstorming ideas to troubleshooting code, they can provide insightful assistance in understanding and applying the topics covered in the course.

However, it's important to remember that these AI models are tools to aid your development process, not replacements for your own critical thinking and creativity. While they can provide you with a spectrum of answers or solutions, it's crucial that you evaluate the appropriateness of those responses in the context of your specific project or problem.

Using these tools effectively involves leveraging their capabilities to enhance your learning and development processes, while also being critical and mindful of their limitations. Always ensure you understand the code and concepts you're working with, using AI tools as supplementary support rather than complete solutions. This approach will help strengthen your coding skills and enable you to write better, more effective code.

Where available, try to use the most advanced version of the AI model, e.g. gpt-4. The more advanced the model, the more accurate and relevant the responses will be.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant. It can be a powerful tool to help you write code more efficiently. It suggests code snippets as you type, based on the patterns it learned from millions of open-source projects. It can be incredibly useful for learning syntax, discovering new methods, and reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks.

However, remember that it's important to understand the code you're writing. Don't rely solely on GitHub Copilot to write code for you. Instead, use it as a learning tool. When Copilot suggests a solution, take the time to understand how and why it works. This will strengthen your coding skills and enable you to write better code, with or without the assistance of AI tools.

Remember, these AI-assisted tools are meant to enhance your learning experience and not to replace the fundamental understanding and application of the knowledge you gain. Make the most of these tools but also be mindful and critical of their limitations.

### Specific Use Cases for AI Tools

Here are some specific use cases where AI-assisted tools can be used effectively for learning in this course:

1. **Writing new code:** When creating new code, you can use tools like GitHub Copilot to assist you, but it's crucial to ensure you understand the code it generates. If you don't, use the AI tool to help explain it. A good prompt could be "Can you explain how this piece of code works?". In addition, when GitHub Copilot suggests multiple solutions, try to understand the differences between them and select the most appropriate one for your project.

2. **Debugging:** When you encounter a bug, first attempt to resolve it yourself. Give yourself a few minutes to analyze and understand the issue. If that doesn't work, you can share your code block with an AI tool. A good prompt could be "I'm encountering an issue with this code. Can you help me understand what's wrong?".

3. **Concept understanding:** If a particular concept seems difficult, don't hesitate to ask the AI tool for alternative explanations. A useful prompt could be "I'm having trouble understanding X. Can you explain it in a different way?".

4. **Additional examples:** AI tools can provide numerous examples on demand. If you want more practice or exposure to a specific concept, simply ask "Can you provide more examples of X?".

5. **Translation:** If English is not your first language, AI-powered translation tools can be invaluable for translating code and documentation. This can help you understand the material more effectively and efficiently. Remember, however, that coding globally is primarily conducted in English. Over time, becoming comfortable with English coding terminology will enhance your ability to participate fully in the global coding community.

  strong foundational understanding and form your own thought processes before
  relying on AI suggestions. Write code by hand, without AI, to strengthen your
  understanding.

I encourage you to utilize AI tools throughout this course. They can be a great aid for learning, debugging, and gaining new insights. However, remember that they might not always be up-to-date with the latest developments, such as the App Router for Next.js.

Despite the assistance AI tools provide, they do not replace the support and guidance of your instructor. Always feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

## Course Philosophy

I would like to share the guiding principles that form the foundation of this course:

1. **Self-evaluation over traditional grading:** In this course, I place emphasis on your understanding and growth over traditional grading. You're encouraged to engage in self-evaluation and reflection, making learning a deeply personal and engaging process.

2. **Hands-on learning through real-world projects:** I firmly believe that the best way to grasp a concept is by doing. You will have the opportunity to work on real-world projects, enhancing your understanding and applying the skills you learn in a practical context.

3. **Learning together:** Collaboration is key to success in the world of web development. By working together on the group project and assignments, you not only learn from your peers but also develop essential soft skills such as teamwork and communication.

4. **Leveraging AI-powered tools:** Embracing the potential of AI, I encourage the use of AI-powered tools like chat-based assistants to support your learning journey. These tools can help with code explanation, debugging, and even provide alternative ways of understanding complex concepts.

5. **Adapting to change:** Web technologies are ever-evolving, and so is this course! I am committed to staying relevant and incorporating the most up-to-date content and technologies in our curriculum. The selection of technologies in this course was guided by relevance and industry trends. React.js, as one of the most widely adopted libraries for building user interfaces, is a natural choice given its prevalence in the industry. Next.js complements this by being the most recommended full-stack framework for React as it simplifies project setup. To ensure a smooth transition into React, we first focus on intermediate JavaScript, building a strong foundational knowledge.
